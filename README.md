# React Native Uninitialized State Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where state variables are accessed before they have been properly initialized.  The issue often arises when asynchronous operations, such as network requests or timers, interact with component state updates.

## Bug Description

The bug is caused by attempting to read the value of a state variable (`count`) before it's had a chance to be initialized by the `useState` hook. This typically occurs when an asynchronous operation (e.g., a timeout) triggers state updates before the component initially renders and sets the state.
